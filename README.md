# FaceDetection-using-Python
Detecting faces and labeling their respective names on the screen using
Libraries:-  OpenCv3.4, OpenCv-contrib3.4, Numpy

First I created dataset and saved 6 face images of same person using Cascade classifier(HaarCascade)
Second I train the model using the dataset I created and saved the training_data.yml file.
Finallly I used the training data to predict the faces using webcam and label their respective name on the screen
The efficiency of this classifier is 50-60 % only. If some know how to improve it more then do tell me @ stiffyms2@gmail.com
